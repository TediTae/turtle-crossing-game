# Turtle Crossing Game üê¢üö¶

## Description
Turtle Crossing Game is a simple arcade-style game built with Python's Turtle graphics module.
The player controls a turtle and tries to cross a busy road without colliding with moving cars.
Each successful crossing increases the level and speed of the cars, making the game progressively harder.

## Features

- Dynamic car generation with increasing speed  
- Level progression system  
- Collision detection between player and cars  
- Scoreboard displaying current level  

## How to Play
- Use the **Up Arrow** key to move the turtle forward.  
- Avoid colliding with cars moving horizontally across the screen.
